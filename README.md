#--------------- Paypal Client ---------------

Handy paypal client which can be used in .net core projects

Only thing you need is to register in paypal website and get you clientid and client secret id.

So you will register the PayPal Service in your startup(maybe you are not using DI then make instance manually).

Call each function which is needed to get create payment, authorize payment, capture or refund it.

:D
